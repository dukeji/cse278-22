Lab 03 Problem1.cpp Question 1: Advanced string operation.The user should input a string. Write your own function to achieve the following function:Eg. “feng17@miamiOh.edu_^&*-----2055”a)Write a function to return how many letters are in the input string.Eg. 14b)Write a function to return how many digits are in the input string.Eg. 6 (1,7,2,0,5,5)c)Write a function to return how many numbers are in the input stringEg. 2 (17, 2055)d)Write a function to check if the input string contains “miami”. Return true or falseEg. truee)Rewrite the function for a) to enable it to make all the letters uppercase or lowercasecontrolled by the main function.f)Write ONE function to implement a), b), c). You can reuse the code in a,b,c but you needto think about how the main function get the results.

problem2.cpp Question 2: Swap the value.Assume the main function contains two variables “a” and “b”, write a function to swap thevalue.

problem3.cpp Input an array of integers (max: 20 numbers), write a function to return the index of localmaximum and local minimum. Return and display it in the main function. When you display theindex, please start with 1. Ignore the boundary
